    <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Cars</h1>

    <h2>Challenger</h2>

  <p style="font-size:22px">The challenger was first created in 1969. While it shared Chrsler's "E-body" which is a short-deck, long hood platform with a thrid-generation
  Plymouth Barracuda, Dodge Challengers have a wheelbase that is two-inches longer then Chrslers which helped to make more interior space. The challenger is a
  sports car that can go to the speeds of 305 Miles Per Hour.</p>

<h3>HellCat</h3>

<p align = "center" style="font-size:22px">The HellCat is the newer version of the challenger. While the challenger can go uo to 392 miles per hour, A HellCat can go up to 204 miles per
hour, and just like the challenger,the HellCat can go from 0-60 miles per hour in about 2.5 seconds.The HellCat right now is called the most powerful
muscle car ever. Now there are a lot of resons to want the HellCat since it's fast, sleak, but when it comes to the price of the HellCat, the
better deal would have to be the original Challenger. The price of a HellCat can run up to $70,280 while a challenger can run up to $26,995.</p>

<h4>Grand Cherokee</h4>

  <p align = "center" style="font-size:22px">The Grand Cherokee a very spacoius car. Although compared to a Jeep Cherokee it has a lot of differences. Like for one, the space. Like I said
    before the Grand Cherokee holds a lot of space, the reason why is because it has a bigger cabin with a larger cargo capacity.Now there are a lot more
    differences when its comes to the Prices, Engine, Horsepower, Torque, Fuel Economy, and its Transmissions. Between the Grand Cherokee and the
    Jeep Cherokee, everything is leading to to Grand Cherokee being the better of the pair even with the Grand Cherokee being a little more expensive,
    the benefits outweigh the con.</p>
  <h4>Jeep</h4>
  <img src="Jeep.jpg" alt="">
  <p align = "center" style="font-size:22px"> A jeep is one of the most owned cars in america, and there are a lot of reasons why the jeep is the most bought car. The first reason it the price, A
  normal jeep can run around $15,995,and for a Jeep Wrangeler the price is about $21,915. Which compaired to normal car, that is a pretty
  good deal.</P>

<h5>Lamborghini</h5>
<img src="lamborghini.jpg" alt="">
<P align = "center" style="font-size:22px"> The Lamborghini is one of the most wanted cars in america, and everyone knows the reason why. Lamborghini's are fast and sleak, and for most
  people that is everyones dream car. Although very few people are able to get a Lamborghini because of the price, the lowest price of a Lamborghini is
  about $399,500, and th highest can run up to 4.5 Million dollars.</p>
